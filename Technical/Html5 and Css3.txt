1. Difference between display:none and visibility:hidden.

display: none: The element is removed from the document flow; it takes up no space.

visibility: hidden: The element is hidden but still takes up space in the layout.



2. What is the difference between inline and inline-block elements?

inline: Elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., <span>).

inline-block: Elements do not start on a new line but can have width and height set (e.g., <img>).



3. Difference between margin and padding.

margin: Space outside an element's border; creates distance between elements.

padding: Space inside an element's border; creates distance between the content and the border.



4. Difference between class and id in CSS.

class: Can be applied to multiple elements; defined with a dot (.) in CSS.

8. Explain Box model in CSS.

The box model describes the rectangular boxes generated for elements, including margins, borders, padding, and the actual content area.



9. Explain block and inline elements.

block elements: Start on a new line, take up the full width available (e.g., <div>, <p>).

inline elements: Do not start on a new line, only take up as much width as necessary (e.g., <span>, <a>).
